# Julia support for Atom

Official Atom package for the Julia language. Originally based off of [JuliaLang/julia.tmBundle](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle).

Features:

- Syntax highlighting
- Snippets for common Julia keywords (see `snippets/language-julia.cson`)
- Snippets to replace LaTex-like greek characters with their unicode equivalent (exact same behavior as at the Julia REPL, i.e. `\alpha[TAB] → α`)
- Snippets for all emoji supported at the REPL

Contributors:

- Everyone who has helped with the [tmBundle](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle)
- Spencer Lyon
